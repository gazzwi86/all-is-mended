    h2.page-header About Me
    p Hi, I'm Shelley, the editor behind All is mended.
    p If you can’t tell from my Shakespeare-inspired business name, I’m a bit of a word nerd, with a Bachelor of Arts (Literary Studies) and a Masters in Publishing and Communication.
    p I've spent the last few years working in the sales and marketing team of a global financial organisation, honing my ability to translate techno-babble and corporate jargon into clear, concise, audience-focused language.
    p Convoluted, inconsistent content can have disastrous results. It wastes time, as your audience has to slow down, carefully navigating your errors and awkward phrasing to reach your key messages. Most of the time they give up, and never arrive at your point.
    p I can mend your hot mess - whether you want to post online or print, publish fiction or non-fiction, produce long think pieces, short product descriptions, or perfect your Instagram captions.
